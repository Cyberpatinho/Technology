# Project: 

First steps using GraphQL with Golang, part of a study of ways in which systems may communicate with one another.



## Notes to self: 

- SQLite3's [mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3), needs CGO to compile. An alternative is to use [modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite?utm_source=godoc), which is a native 
  translation, but suffer from slower inserts.
